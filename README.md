# QuizBlazor
Adapted from the tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aeiZUKV4io 
I've just changed how they questions are readin, instead of hard coding them, they come from the questions.json file. 
The files to look at are Questions.razor and Questions.razor.cs, as well as the component in the Components folder. Everything else is out of the box.
This works as is, lacks styling.
